# Bike Sales Dashboard Project

This project involves creating an interactive dashboard in Microsoft Excel to analyze bike sales data. The dashboard provides insights into customer demographics and purchasing behaviors, facilitating data-driven decision-making.

## Problem Statement

The objective is to develop a comprehensive Excel dashboard that visualizes bike sales data, enabling stakeholders to:

- Identify trends and patterns in customer demographics.
- Analyze factors influencing bike purchases.
- Make informed business decisions based on data insights.

## Project Steps

The project follows these key steps:

1. **Data Import**: Load the raw bike sales data into Excel.

2. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Remove duplicate entries.
   - Standardize categorical variables (e.g., marital status, gender).
   - Create age brackets for analysis.
   - Rename values for clarity (e.g., commute distances).

3. **Data Analysis**:
   - Create pivot tables to summarize data:
     - Average income by gender and purchase status.
     - Number of purchases by age bracket.
     - Commute distance distribution among purchasers.

4. **Data Visualization**:
   - Develop charts based on pivot tables:
     - Bar charts for average income analysis.
     - Line charts for purchase trends by age.
     - Column charts for commute distance distribution.

5. **Dashboard Assembly**:
   - Create a new worksheet titled 'Dashboard'.
   - Design a title section with merged cells and formatting.
   - Arrange and insert charts into the dashboard.

6. **Interactivity Enhancement**:
   - Add slicers to allow dynamic filtering by demographics.

## Usage
